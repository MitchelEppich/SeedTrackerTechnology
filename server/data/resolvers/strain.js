Known for smaller dense buds and moderate-sized harvests Haze Xtreme will give you a body and head high allowing you to excel at daily activities while maintaining creative conversations. These are regular Haze Xtreme cannabis seeds. What that means is that all of these seeds are a mixture of both male and female. When you grow them, the males should be separated from the females so that they do not pollinate. If they are kept together and pollinate, you'll have a bunch of seeds produced with no flowers. When growing marijuana for making a usable flower, it's important to keep the plants separate once they start growing. Telling the difference between male and female plants is as easy as checking the preflowers when they grow. A 'pre-flower' is when the plants start to flower the males will produce preflowers that are 'ball' shaped and the females will produce preflowers that are 'pistil' shaped. Haze Xtreme is mostly sativa and can reach up to 10 weeks to flower. The effect is awesome with a body and head high which will leave you awake so this is not good for a night smoke. This is fit for those who want to keep active and productive with their day-to-day activities. If you want to experience an extreme result of Haze then Haze Xtreme is the right cannabis strain for you.",

What 'regular' means is that all of the seeds are a mixture of both male & female. The males have to be separated when they are grown so that they do not pollinate the females. Only if the plants are left together to pollinate, the plants will produce a bunch of seeds & no flowers. It's very important to separate the plants once they start growing if your growing cannabis to produce a usable flower. Telling the difference between male and female plants is as easy as checking the plants when they start to flower. When the cannabis plants start to flower, males will produce preflowers that are 'ball' shaped and the females will produce preflowers that are 'pistil' shaped.",
